    "2. To run a code cell, click the cell to select it and press `Shift + Enter`. The output of the code should appear below the cell.\n",
    "3. In general, notebooks only run correctly if you run every code cell in order from top to bottom. If you run cells out of order, you are likely to get errors.\n",
    "4. You can modify existing cells, but then you have to run them again to see the effect.\n",
    "5. You can add new cells, but again, you have to be careful about the order you run them in.\n",
    "6. If you added or modified cells and the behavior of the notebook seems strange, you can restart the \"kernel\", which clears all of the variables and functions you have defined, and run the cells again from the beginning.\n",
